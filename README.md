PGLib
=====

PGLib is a set of two libraries (PGSocket and PGThread) for C++. These libraries provide some classes and methods to use sockets and threads (respectively) in a cross-platform environment without having to deal with Windows or Linux native libraries. I developed these libraries to make my degree final project in 2012.
